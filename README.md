# VocabularyApp

Android application for testing of Vocabulary. User can download vocabularies from our API and browse and test words placed in it. Vocabularies are splitted into files, so user can download only part of vocabulary. Vocabulary definitions are in testing phase right now, but the client application is fully functional.
